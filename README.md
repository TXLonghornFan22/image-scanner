# image-scanner
Main purpose of this program is to help me with making Rubik's cube mosaics and finding images that work.

Uses an image scanner to scan the RGB values of each pixel.
Takes those values and splits them into three arrays, one for R, G, and B values.
Compares the RGB values to the RGB values of the 6 colors of my mini Rubik's cubes.
Puts a precentage of how close the cube colors are to the actual colors and gives an overall percentage of how  close the altered picture represents the original picture.
May eventually try to add in a feature where I can put how many cubes I have and a group of images, and it will tell me the best images to use.
